				Augusta Ada Kin g, Countess of Lovelace (nÃ©e Byron; <strong>10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852</strong>) was an
				English mathematician
				and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the
				Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and
				to
				have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often
				regarded
				as the first computer programmer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ada Byron was the only child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron's other children were born out
				of
				wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever
				four months
				later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA!
				sole
				daughter of my house and heart?".[7] He died in Greece when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter
				and
				promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's
				perceived
				insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her eventual
				death,
				she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies
				assiduously. She
				married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

			<h2>Here's a part of time line of Ada Lovelace life:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>10 December 1815</strong>
						- Born in London, England.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>1832</strong>
						When she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest
						in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>1833</strong>
						Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to
						Charles Babbage
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>1834</strong>
						Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events Analytical Engine.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>1842</strong>
						During a nine-month period in 1842â€“43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's
						article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of
						notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as many other scientists did not
						really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. Lovelace's notes
						even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. Her work was
						well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The notes are around two times longer than the article itself and include (in Note G), in complete
						detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might
						have run correctly had it ever been built (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in
						London in 2002). Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer
						programmer and her method has been called the world's first computer program. Others dispute this
						because some of Charles Babbage's earlier writings could be considered computer programs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that "The Analytical Engine
						has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It
						can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." This objection
						has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper "Computing
						Machinery and Intelligence".
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>1843</strong>
						Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.
						She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better
						part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the
						Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever
						specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first
						computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>...</li>
				<li><strong>27 November 1852</strong> - Died Marylebone, London, England she has just 36 years old.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<pre id="poem">

				And when thou would'st solace gatherâ€”
				 When our child's first accents flowâ€”
				Wilt thou teach her to say "Father!"
				 Though his care she must forego?
				When her little hands shall press theeâ€”
				 When her lip to thine is pressedâ€”
				Think of him whose prayer shall bless theeâ€”
				 Think of him thy love had blessed!
				Should her lineaments resemble
				 Those thou never more may'st see,
				Then thy heart will softly tremble
				 With a pulse yet true to me.

					<em><b>"Fare Thee Well"</b></em> is an 1816 poem by <strong>Lord Byron</strong>
